The Schulze Method is a voting system that selects a single winner from votes in the form of preferences.  The system is monotonic, meaning a candidate should not be changed in rank if that candidate is raised or lowered on some ballots without changing the order of the other candidates, and condorcet, which means the winner is the candidate who, when compared with every other candidate, is preferred by more voters.  It was developed in 1997.

Although it's not yet used in parliamentary elections, public organizations have begun adapting it, including: the Wikimedia Foundation, the Knight Foundation, Gentoo, Debian, Free Software Foundation Europe, Metalab, and Noisebridge.
